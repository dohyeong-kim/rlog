      <title>2022-02-22 Large Fields</title>
      <p>
        A field <m>k</m> is called large if no smooth curves 
        <m>C/k</m> have nonempty finite <m>C(k)</m>. 
        Equivalently, if <m>k</m> is large, then a smooth curve <m>C/k</m> 
        has either empty <m>C(k)</m> or infinite <m>C(k)</m>. 
        The notion is due to F. Pop. 
        In <url href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1310" visual="Bary-Soroker and Fehm"/>, Question I asks whether <m>\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty)</m>, the field generated by all roots of unity, is large or not.

        Let $X(N)$ be the modular curve for the full level-$N$ structure, where $N\ge1$ is an integer. Since its cusps are defined over $\mathbb Q(\mu_N)$, $X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))$ is non-empty. If $\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty)$ were large, then $X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_{\infty}))$ must be infinite.
          \par  
        
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Can we prove whether $X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))$ is infinite for all $N$?
            \item Can we prove whether $X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))$ is infinite for infinitely many $N$?
        \end{enumerate}
        We can ask similar questions for $X_0(N)$ or $X_1(N)$. 
        \par
        Here are some motivations for the questions above. If $X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))$ is infinite, it means that there is a sequence of elliptic curves $E_i/\mathbb Q(\mu_{M_i})$, $i=1,2,\cdots$, such that $E_i[N]$ generates an absolutely abelian field. Then, for $p \mid N$, $E_i[p^\infty]$ would generated a pro-$p$ extension, say $F_\infty$ of an abelian field $F$. To the extension $F_\infty/F$, the theorem of Coates-Sujatha \cite{Coates-Sujatha-05} can be applied, verifying some instance of the $\mathfrak M_H(G)$-conjecture.
