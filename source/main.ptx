      <title>2022-02-22 Large Fields</title>
      <p>
        A field <m>k</m> is called large if no smooth curves 
        <m>C/k</m> have nonempty finite <m>C(k)</m>. 
        Equivalently, if <m>k</m> is large, then a smooth curve <m>C/k</m> 
        has either empty <m>C(k)</m> or infinite <m>C(k)</m>. 
        The notion is due to F. Pop. 
        In <url href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1310" visual="Bary-Soroker and Fehm"/>, Question I asks whether <m>\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty)</m>, the field generated by all roots of unity, is large or not.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Let <m>X(N)</m> be the modular curve for the full level-<m>N</m> structure, where <m>N\ge1</m> 
        is an integer. Since its cusps are defined over <m>\mathbb Q(\mu_N)</m>,
        <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))</m> is non-empty. 
        If <m>\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty)</m> were large, 
        then <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_{\infty}))</m> must be infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Can we prove whether <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))</m> is infinite for all <m>N</m>?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Can we prove whether <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))</m> is infinite for infinitely many <m>N</m>?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        We can ask similar questions for <m>X_0(N)</m> or <m>X_1(N)</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some motivations for the questions above. If <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))</m> is infinite, 
        it means that there is a sequence of elliptic curves <m>E_i/\mathbb Q(\mu_{M_i})</m>, <m>i=1,2,\cdots</m>, 
        such that <m>E_i[N]</m> generates an absolutely abelian field. 
        Then, for <m>p \mid N</m>, <m>E_i[p^\infty]</m> would generated a pro-<m>p</m> extension, say 
        <m>F_\infty</m> of an abelian field <m>F</m>. To the extension <m>F_\infty/F</m>, the theorem of Coates<mdash/>Sujatha can be applied, 
        verifying some instance of the <m>\mathfrak M_H(G)</m>-conjecture.

        Here are some motivations for the questions above. If $X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))$ is infinite, it means that there is a sequence of elliptic curves $E_i/\mathbb Q(\mu_{M_i})$, $i=1,2,\cdots$, such that $E_i[N]$ generates an absolutely abelian field. Then, for $p \mid N$, $E_i[p^\infty]$ would generated a pro-$p$ extension, say $F_\infty$ of an abelian field $F$. To the extension $F_\infty/F$, the theorem of Coates-Sujatha \cite{Coates-Sujatha-05} can be applied, verifying some instance of the $\mathfrak M_H(G)$-conjecture.
