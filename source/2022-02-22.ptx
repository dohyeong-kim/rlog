    <title>2022-02-22 Large Fields</title>
    <p>
      A field <m>k</m> is called large if no smooth curves 
      <m>C/k</m> have nonempty finite <m>C(k)</m>. 
      Equivalently, if <m>k</m> is large, then a smooth curve <m>C/k</m> 
      has either empty <m>C(k)</m> or infinite <m>C(k)</m>. 
      The notion is due to F. Pop. 
      In <url href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1310" visual="Bary-Soroker and Fehm"/>, Question I asks whether <m>\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty)</m>, the field generated by all roots of unity, is large or not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Let <m>X(N)</m> be the modular curve for the full level-<m>N</m> structure, where <m>N\ge1</m> 
      is an integer. Since its cusps are defined over <m>\mathbb Q(\mu_N)</m>,
      <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))</m> is non-empty. 
      If <m>\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty)</m> were large, 
      then <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_{\infty}))</m> must be infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Can we prove whether <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))</m> is infinite for all <m>N</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Can we prove whether <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))</m> is infinite for infinitely many <m>N</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      We can ask similar questions for <m>X_0(N)</m> or <m>X_1(N)</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some motivations for the questions above. If <m>X(N)(\mathbb Q(\mu_\infty))</m> is infinite, 
      it means that there is a sequence of elliptic curves <m>E_i/\mathbb Q(\mu_{M_i})</m>, <m>i=1,2,\cdots</m>, 
      such that <m>E_i[N]</m> generates an absolutely abelian field. 
      Then, for <m>p \mid N</m>, <m>E_i[p^\infty]</m> would generated a pro-<m>p</m> extension, say 
      <m>F_\infty</m> of an abelian field <m>F</m>. To the extension <m>F_\infty/F</m>, the theorem of Coates<mdash/>Sujatha can be applied, 
      verifying some instance of the <m>\mathfrak M_H(G)</m>-conjecture.
