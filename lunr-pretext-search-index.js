The notion is due to F. Pop. In , Question I asks whether , the field generated by all roots of unity, is large or not.  Let be the modular curve for the full level- structure, where is an integer. Since its cusps are defined over , is non-empty. If were large, then must be infinite.     Can we prove whether is infinite for all ?    Can we prove whether is infinite for infinitely many ?   We can ask similar questions for or .  Here are some motivations for the questions above. If is infinite, it means that there is a sequence of elliptic curves , , such that generates an absolutely abelian field. Then, for , would generated a pro- extension, say of an abelian field . To the extension , the theorem of Coates Sujatha can be applied, verifying some instance of the -conjecture.   "
