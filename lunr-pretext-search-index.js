Then, the Iwasawa Main Conjecture for is known when is odd. If is not abelian, then the conjecture is not known. If is abelian, then the validity of conjecture implies that the fine selmer group for , denoted as is finitely generated over .  Natural question is how to prove the finite generation of without proving conjecture in the main conjecture. Here is a vague idea. The main conjecture in this case is proved by Wiles using Deligne-Ribet -adic -function and Eisenstein congruences. That is to say, suitable extensions are constructed using Galois representation of a Hilbert cuspform whose reduction modulo some power of the maximal ideal is upper-triangular. Classes in correspond to those extensions that split at places above . That is to say, the is locally decomposable at places above , at least taking a reduction.  Hida showed local indecomposability of non-CM Hilbert cusp forms. I heard of some rumors that his initial proof had some errors and he fixed them. A recent exposition is with an appendix by Hida.  The question is, can you deduce finite generation of the fine Selmer groups from the local indecomposability?  "

  "body": " 2022-02-22 Large Fields  A field is called large if no smooth curves have nonempty finite . Equivalently, if is large, then a smooth curve has either empty or infinite . The notion is due to F. Pop. In , Question I asks whether , the field generated by all roots of unity, is large or not.  Let be the modular curve for the full level- structure, where is an integer. Since its cusps are defined over , is non-empty. If were large, then must be infinite.     Can we prove whether is infinite for all ?    Can we prove whether is infinite for infinitely many ?   We can ask similar questions for or .  Here are some motivations for the questions above. If is infinite, it means that there is a sequence of elliptic curves , , such that generates an absolutely abelian field. Then, for , would generated a pro- extension, say of an abelian field . To the extension , the theorem of Coates Sujatha can be applied, verifying some instance of the -conjecture.  "
